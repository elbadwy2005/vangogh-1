<h1>Vincent Van Gogh</h1>
<main>
    <div></div>
    <div><p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter born in 1853, whose bold colors and expressive brushwork revolutionized modern art. Although he only painted for about a decade, he produced over 2,000 works, including around 900 paintings. Some of his most famous pieces include Starry Night, Sunflowers, and The Bedroom. Van Gogh struggled with mental illness and poverty throughout his life, and his unique style was under appreciated during his lifetime. Today, he is regarded as one of the most influential artists in history.</p></div>
    <div><p>Van Goghâ€™s art stands out for its emotional intensity and innovative use of color and movement. He often painted landscapes, portraits, and still lifes, capturing ordinary subjects with extraordinary feeling. His swirling skies, vibrant sunflowers, and textured brushstrokes communicate energy and passion, reflecting his inner struggles. Despite facing rejection and selling only one painting while alive, his work gained immense recognition after his death in 1890. His legacy inspires countless artists, and his paintings remain some of the most beloved in museums worldwide.</p></div>
